Minecraft Enchantment Simulator
-------------------------------

Instructions:
Just open index.html in chrome. (Almost works in firefox. Should work in safari, but that is untested.)

Choose material and item type from the menu at the top. The graphs will immediately update to represent the simulated probability of receiving different possible enchantments. Use the + and - buttons to select a chosen enchantment level and see how the probabilities change.



Details:
-------

The script will run a simulated enchantment of given item at given level a given number of times. The procedure matches what the minecraft source code does at version 1.0.0, and should be pretty representative.
The data from the simulations, basically a count of how many times each enchantment was received, is then shown in bar chart form. Mouseover the bars for detailed information.

Charts:
Total enchantment distribution. - This is the most relevant result of the simulation. Each enchantment seen is represented by a bar, with the height being set to the percentage of times that enchantment was seen. Note that since some simulations generate several enchantments at once, the sum of the percentages often become more than 100. (How much more is given as "enchantment count saturation" in the info box.)

First enchantment distribution - This is the old versions chart. It only accounts for the first enchantment given in each simulation. This will make the percentages for the different charts add up to 100 percent, but it should really be disregarded. It will probably be removed in a future version.

Number of enchantments distribution - A simple chart that shows the probability of receiving multiple enchantments.


Info box:
This is mainly the bar charts in text form for usability purposes.




TODO:
----
Add calculated standard deviation for each bar.
